    "## About Naive Bayes\n",
    "The Naive Bayes algorithm is an intuitive method that uses the probabilities of each attribute belonging to each class to make a prediction. It is the supervised learning approach you would come up with if you wanted to model a predictive modeling problem probabilistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes simplifies the calculation of probabilities by assuming that the probability of each attribute belonging to a given class value is independent of all other attributes. This is a strong assumption but results in a fast and effective method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of a class value given a value of an attribute is called the conditional probability. By multiplying the conditional probabilities together for each attribute for a given class value, we have a probability of a data instance belonging to that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction we can calculate probabilities of the instance belonging to each class and select the class value with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bases is often described using categorical data because it is easy to describe and calculate using ratios. A more useful version of the algorithm for our purposes supports numeric attributes and assumes the values of each numerical attribute are normally distributed (fall somewhere on a bell curve). Again, this is a strong assumption, but still gives robust results."
